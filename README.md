## Chore Tracker - Next.js & React App

This is a chore tracker application built with Next.js and React. It allows you to create, assign, and track chores for your household or any group.

### Features

* Create and assign chores with due dates and descriptions.
* Mark chores as completed to track progress.
* View a list of all chores, including completed and upcoming ones.
* Filter chores by assignee or status (completed/incomplete).

### Getting Started

#### Using the test deployment

To run the test deployment, go to the following URL:


```
https://household-hero.vercel.app/
```

You can just play around with it. If the user cap is reached, you can also build it yourself

#### Building your own deployment

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Peleton-011/chore-tracker.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd chore-tracker
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Usage

The application provides a user interface for managing chores. You can create new chores, assign them to users, and mark them as completed. Filters allow you to focus on specific chores based on assignee or completion status.

### Technologies Used

* Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
